# WorktreeProof Complete Workflow (L99 + Ultra + Plugins + Skills)

> **One workflow, zero gaps.** This is the single authoritative end-to-end
> process for every WorktreeProof lane, session, and release. It combines the
> L99 discipline (immutable contracts, terminal-only evidence), the Ultra/free
> model routing profile, the OpenCode plugins (Chrome, Computer, Goal/Plan,
> WorktreeProof CLI), and the curated skill stack (Superpowers, Anthropic
> official, Vercel official, OpenAI Codex, WorktreeProof skills).

## 0. The invariant

Every item of work goes through the same loop, no exceptions:

```
GOAL → CONTRACT → PLAN → RESERVE → RUN → EVIDENCE → REVIEW → MERGE → RELEASE → LAUNCH
```

Progress is **terminal-only**: `terminalClosed / terminalTotal`. Plans,
branches, commits, tests without a named acceptance gate, and commentary are
**zero progress**. No invented percentages, no invented ETAs
(`FORECAST_UNAVAILABLE` unless the owner explicitly asks and ≥3 comparable
gates exist).

## 2. Plugin map (which plugin for which action)

| Action | Plugin / tool |
|---|---|
| Any browser/web task | `chrome_*` tools from `integrations/opencode-plugin-chrome-use` — **ONLY via the Chrome Bridge extension relay** (`chrome_connect` endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:9333`; extension ID `epppjbfmmabiphlgeokdichnhhklabep` in the user's normal no-port Chrome). The 9222 debug-port "Chrome portal" is retired for browser automation; port 9222 is Token-Free Gateway only (never automate, never kill). Never a dedicated automation profile, guest/incognito, or logged-out Chrome. |
| Any visible desktop task | `computer_*` tools from `integrations/opencode-plugin-computer-use` (screenshot, mouse, keyboard, windows via nut-js) |

Both plugins are registered as OpenCode plugins: live config
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` (`plugin` array) and repo
`.opencode/opencode.jsonc`. Prefer `chrome_*` for anything inside a browser;
fall back to `computer_*` only for non-browser desktop apps or when the relay
is down — and per the owner's UI-automation lesson, if desktop clicking keeps
losing focus fights, switch to headless verification instead of looping.

| Lane lifecycle | `wp_plan`, `wp_reserve`, `wp_run`, `wp_close`, `wp_release`, `wp_status`, `wp_validate` |
| Goal/contract/ledger | `goal_set`, `plan_create`, `task_start`, `task_done` (evidence required), `review_gate`, `review_summary` |
| Diagnostics | `wp_doctor`, `wp_capabilities`, `wp_cleanup`, `wp_leases`, `wp_tools`, `wp_recipes`, `wp_resources` |
| Interop | `wp_bridge_inbox`, `wp_manifest` |

**Boundaries (never crossed by any agent):** passwords/OTP/CAPTCHA/passkeys
(owner only), billing/account-security (owner only), live trade execution
(owner only, permanent), credentials in logs/commits/receipts (never printed).

## 3. Ultra + free model router profile

The Ultra workflow keeps the parent at maximum reasoning while routing work to
free/cheap helpers through the local model router:

1. Parent (`gpt-5.6-sol` / Ultra) reasons, decomposes, decides, reviews — and
   **always delegates proactively like native Codex Ultra**: never inline when
   independent helpers exist, never waits for a delegation request.
2. Lanes dispatch through the free model router (`opencode`, `aihubmix`,
   `zenmux`, `nvidia` free tiers) at **standard speed** — never Fast mode, no
   `service_tier: fast`, no `features.fast_mode`.
3. Helper models: Luna `max` for independent diagnosis/design; Terra `high`
   for ordinary implementation; `medium` for mechanically verifiable work;
   never `low`.
4. **Token-Free Gateway (internal helper free pool).** The local gateway at
   `http://127.0.0.1:3456/v1` (provider `gateway`, name "Token-Free Gateway")
   exposes free Claude (Sonnet 4/4.6, Opus 4/4.6, Haiku 4/4.6), GPT-4 family,
   DeepSeek Chat/Reasoner, Gemini Pro/Ultra, GLM 4 Plus/Think, and Kimi 8K/32K
   models with high/max reasoning variants. These are part of the internal
   helper free pool and are preferred for lane work when the primary free
   tiers are unavailable or a lane needs a different model family — same
   rules apply: standard speed, never Fast mode, one attempt then drop on
   failure, helpers never become authority gates.
5. NVIDIA models: **one instant attempt per model, then DROP** — never retry,
   cool down, poll, or sweep.
6. **Parallel dispatch (native Ultra swarm).** Up to **20 internal helper
   lanes** run in parallel: batch-dispatch every genuinely independent open
   item at session start (all at once, before any completes), backfill each
   returning slot in the same turn, keep one closed scope per lane. Idle slots
   are the failure, busy ones are not; an idle slot is acceptable only when no
   independent item exists — never spawn to occupy capacity, never sidebar/
   user-visible overflow, never recursive trees. Effective pool = intersection
   of independent non-overlapping scopes and live resources (host cap observed
   at 12; requested 20; supported ceiling 24).
7. Backfill a freed slot immediately while independent items exist; idle slots
   are the failure, busy ones are not. Spawning solely to occupy capacity is a
   violation.

## 4. The L99 lane lifecycle (every lane)

1. **Contract (immutable).** `goal_set` with one outcome, named terminal gates,
   fixed `terminalTotal`, allowed scope, authoritative baseline SHA, deadline
   or `none`. Frozen before the first mutation. Changing it = new contract,
   new identity.
2. **Plan.** `plan_create` with non-overlapping tasks; every task carries a
   named terminal acceptance condition and concrete scope.
3. **Reserve.** `wp_reserve --scope <relative> --dry-run` to preview, then
   `--dry-run false` to reserve. Duplicate IDs, overlapping scopes, and unsafe
   paths fail closed.
4. **Run.** `wp_run` with argv (no shell), bounded/redacted output, timeout.
5. **Evidence.** `wp_close` with an explicit receipt; `task_done` only with
   terminal evidence. No evidence = no close.
6. **Review.** `review_gate` (all tasks done + evidence) then `review_summary`
   (`terminalClosed/terminalTotal`, `FORECAST_UNAVAILABLE`).
7. **Merge.** One PR per gate advance; name the gate in the PR description.
   Merge only with CI/CodeQL/dependency-review green; record
   `git rev-parse origin/main` plus public check URLs.
8. **Cleanup.** `wp_cleanup` inventory; delete superseded branches/worktrees in
   the same session. Never `--force` a dirty checkout — preserve for bounded
   rescue.
9. **Activity log.** Every merge/deploy/mutation gets its own row in
   `docs/agent-activity-log.md`, shipped in the same commit.

---

## 5. Safety gates (fail closed, every time)

- **SAFE-3 circuit breaker** at the lifecycle entry point: every normal
  `agent:worktree` call needs a current `--circuit-breaker-json`; missing,
  malformed, or tripped state fails closed before branch/worktree creation.
- **F13 no-output breaker:** at 40 tool calls since the last terminal closure
  with zero closures, freeze new spawns/backfill, secure or abandon dirty
  work, report zero plus one blocker, end the turn.
- **F1 no silent wait:** never hold a turn waiting on a reply that may never
  come; write one `TRUE BLOCKER / OWNER ACTION REQUIRED` line and stop.
- **F2 no retry loops:** 3 strikes on the same error class → fix the
  parameter, skip, or report; never a fourth retry.
- **F6 bounded spend:** > ~1M tokens or > ~40 tool-call cycles without a
  committed artifact → STOP and report.
- **F11/F12 truth:** one frozen contract, one goal; progress is
  `terminal_closed/terminal_total` with named gates and concrete evidence;
  deadlines are immutable (`MISSED` never reset).

## 6. Release checklist (per version)

1. `npm run check` (lint + 188 tests) green on `origin/main`.
2. `npm run eval` (9 seeded fail-closed checks) green.
3. `npm run benchmark` emits schema-conformant output.
4. `npm run release:integrity` (SBOM + checksums + manifest + provenance).
5. Clean-install proof: fresh `npm install <pkg>@<version>` on Node 20/22/24,
   full lifecycle `plan→reserve→run→close→release→validate` → `valid:true`.
6. Activity-log row for the release.
7. Tag, release workflow, verify registry/release metadata, record URLs.

---

## 7. Launch checklist (OSS visibility)

1. Verify release URL, license (Apache-2.0), local-first privacy boundaries,
   and limitations.
2. Draft destination-specific messages (HN Show HN, r/ClaudeAI,
   r/ChatGPTCoding, r/opensource, r/node, r/SideProject, dev.to, X).
3. Every draft: names what was built, tested capabilities, Apache-2.0,
   privacy, limitations, release link; no vote/star begging, no manufactured
   engagement, no false claims (honest metrics: 0 stars/0 downloads are fine).
4. Post once per destination through logged-in owner accounts; capture public
   URLs and timestamps only.
5. Record in activity log; popularity is an observed metric, never an
   acceptance claim.

## 8. Definitions of done

| Gate | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Lane closed | `wp_close` receipt + `review_gate` ready + merged to `origin/main` |
| Goal closed | All plan tasks `done` with evidence; `terminalClosed = terminalTotal` |
| Release closed | Tag + npm + GitHub artifacts + SBOM + checksums + provenance + install proof |
| Launch closed | Public post URLs + timestamps, redacted |

## 9. The no-gap audit (run this checklist before declaring any goal done)

- [ ] One immutable contract exists (`goal_set`) with fixed denominator
- [ ] Plan exists with named gates and scopes (`plan_create`)
- [ ] Every task is either pending, in_progress, done-with-evidence, or blocked
- [ ] No overlapping scopes, no duplicate lane IDs
- [ ] Every `done` task has explicit terminal evidence (`task_done`)
- [ ] `review_gate` returns ready
- [ ] Merge landed on `origin/main`, `git rev-parse origin/main` recorded
- [ ] CI/CodeQL/dependency review green on the merge commit
- [ ] Superseded branches/worktrees deleted in-session
- [ ] Activity-log row exists for merge/deploy/mutation
- [ ] No credentials, secrets, or private paths in commits/logs/receipts
- [ ] `FORECAST_UNAVAILABLE` unless explicitly authorized forecast exists
- [ ] No daemons, schedulers, or standing monitors were created
- [ ] Release (if any) verified from a clean install, SBOM/checksums recorded
- [ ] Launch messages (if any) disclose affiliation, license, limitations
